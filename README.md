# Bleichenbachers "Million Message Attack" on RSA

This repo contains two python projects to demonstrate Daniel Bleichenbacher's million message attack against RSA encryption and PKCS #1 padding.

## PKCS #1 Padding Oracle

The bleichenbacher oracle is implemented in `Bleichenbacher_Oracle`.

## RSA Parity Oracle

The effects of leaking the LSB (the Parity-Bit) of an RSA plaintext is demonstrated via `Parity_Oracle`.

The code is mostly taken from [Practical-Padding-Oracle-Attacks-on-RSA](http://secgroup.dais.unive.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Practical-Padding-Oracle-Attacks-on-RSA.html). Since we find it very helpful to understand the Bleichenbacher oracle, it is included here as well.

# Good to know

* The `python-crypto` package is needed for the Parity Oracle. The `tlslite-ng` is needed for the Bleichenbacher Oracle. Please install them.
* Text in Python 3 is always Unicode and represented by the `str` type. Binary data is represented by the `bytes` type. Please see http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/01/30/the-bytesstr-dichotomy-in-python-3 for further information.
* We had some trouble with type errors during development. Thus, many functions are type-checked via a custom decorator and special annotations. (We found this pattern to be very useful in many scenarios.)
